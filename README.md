This case study is a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It is an optional case study to demonstrate the new skills I have learned throughout the certificate. The primary focus of this case study is to follow the six steps of data analysis that were emphasized in this specialization. These steps include Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act. To view my analysis please view BellabeatCaseStudy.Rmd.
